# Hello World
This example displays "Hello World" in the middle of the screen and is intended as a super simple, minimal example to show how to display text on the screen.

## Usage

Install the Paperd.ink library as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.paperd.ink). Change the `PAPERDINK_DEVICE` on the first line in the example if you have a Merlot Paperd.ink, leave it as is when you have a Classic one. Compile and upload this example to the Paperd.ink device. If everything is successful, the text "Hello World" is displayed in white on a black background.
